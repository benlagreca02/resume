\section{Education and Academics}

    \subsection{Rochester Institute of Technology \hfill Graduation: May 2025}
    Computer Engineering, Masters \& Bachelor of Science (Dual degree Masters/Bachelors 
    program), GPA: 3.7
    % \subsection{Lockport High School \hfill Class of 2020}
    % Graduated in top 10\%. National, Science, and Mathematics Honors society member.

\section {Skills}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item
            C/C++, Python, VHDL, and Dart/Flutter programming
        \item
            Linux and Linux tools including git, Vim, gcc, gdb, valgrind, make,
            bash, etc
        \item
            Computer Networking and Linux Socket Programming
        \item
            Soldering, Crimping, and making wire harnesses \& connectors for various 
            applications
        % \item
            % Basic knowledge of the {\LaTeX} software system
    \end{itemize}
\section{Projects}
    \subsection{Nintendo 64 Controller Adapter}
    Used an Arduino Uno to interface with and recieve data from a Nintendo 64
    controller, which sent that data to a Arduino Pro-Micro over I2C. The
    Pro-micro emulated a generic gamepad over USB. Requried understanding of the
    communication protocol, and deep understanding of the Arduino's I/O system due 
    to timing constraints.

    \subsection{Python Biamp Network Discovery Tool}
    Wrote a Python program that discovers devices from the Tesira
    product line. The program sends a packet to a multicast address that Tesira
    devices listened to, and devices responded with relevant info. The program
    then could request more data from each device through a proprietary
    protocol. Displays data obtained in a PyQt5 generated GUI. Required low level 
    networking, and a strong understanding of socket programming.

    % \subsection{Simplified MIPS processor}
    % Created a simplified, Pipelined MIPS processor using VHDL in Digital Systems 
    % Design II.

\section{Experience}

    \subsection{L3Harris Systems/Software Engineering Co-op \hfill (May -
    August 2023)}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item Aided in patent filing and research, implementation, and
                design of a protocol for a new tactical router.
            \item Designed and implemented Linux socket code for a new tactical
                router.
            \item Reverse engineered iproute2 package for functionality of
                netlink sockets. Used netlink sockets for IP GRE tunnel creation and
                modification.
